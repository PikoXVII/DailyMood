# 🌱 DailyMood

DailyMood is a collaborative Android project built by a small team with a shared goal:  
to explore how everyday emotions can be captured in a simple, calm, and human-centered mobile experience.

The project was driven by curiosity, creativity, and learning — not by grades or formal evaluation.

---

## ✨ Idea & Vision

The core idea behind DailyMood is reflection, not productivity.

We wanted to design an app that:
- feels personal rather than intrusive
- focuses on emotional awareness instead of performance
- encourages users to pause and reflect, even briefly

The experience is intentionally minimal:
**choose a mood → add a short note → revisit later.**

---

## 👥 Team Collaboration

DailyMood was built as a **team project**, where collaboration was just as important as the final product.

As a team, we:
- discussed user experience decisions together
- iterated on design ideas through feedback
- divided responsibilities while keeping a shared vision
- reviewed and refined each other’s work

This collaboration helped us practice not only Android development, but also communication, planning, and teamwork.

## 🙋‍♂️ My Personal Contribution

Within the team, I was personally involved in:

- Core UI development using **Jetpack Compose**
- State handling and screen logic
- Navigation flow between main features
- UX decisions around when actions should appear or stay hidden
- Refining interactions to keep the app calm and intentional
- Debugging and improving structure as the project evolved

I focused on clarity, usability, and learning-by-building.
